This post contains a bunch of tool usage snippets and some personal thoughts and experiences with pentesting.

# Personal Thoughts

Most of my pentesting knowledge comes from [Offsec's PWK course](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/), so take the following thoughts as _opinions_ formed by that experience. I don't know everything, but I hope my thoughts and compiled resources can be of help to you.

## Mindset

I'm convinced that the most important skills to be successful at pentesting are **determination** and **persistence**. Having the will to press forward and try new things after 5 hours of struggle is a _valuable_ skill. Hence the Offensive Security motto "Try Harder." 

Sure. You need to understand basic hacking stuff, but those are easier skills to develop than _the will to press on_. When beginning to learn about pentesting, just understand that you're going to make mistakes that will waste hours of you time. Just accept that reality, and don't let it get you down. Everyone who is ahead of you has been there before, _trust **me**_. 

## Buffer Overflows

Buffer Overflows are an important thing to learn about if you're trying to gain a deeper appreciation for exploitation. For the purposes of the OSCP though, you'll learn everything you need to know in the coursework to be successful.

## Understanding What's Happening

**Script Kitties.** Everybody was one at some point. The thing is, you should try to dig in and gain deeper understanding about how systems work, what exactly certain tools do, how particular protocols work and how they've been exploited. Don't just download a script off of Exploit-DB and fire away. Sure, it may work, but did you actually learn anything after landing a shell someone else's code got for you? Learn some basic coding conventions if you don't already know how to program, and try to understand what an exploit actually does.  

## Process 

You also need to develop your own process...

# Information Gathering

## Nmap

- Most useful Nmap option:

```bash
nmap -h | grep <anything>
```

Sorry for that one... But seriously, the help output on Nmap is very useful, but VERY verbose. Most of the time, your `nmap` commands are going to be pretty intense, so knowing how to find different options is necessary for this tool.

- Example Usage:

```bash
# Verbose Output, Service/Version info, SYN Scan, T<0-5> faster execution
nmap -v -sV -sS -T4 <target>
```

- Specifying Ports:

```bash
# You can specify what most-used ports you want to scan
nmap --top-ports=20 <target>
# You can also specify ALL ports
nmap -p- <target>
# A list
nmap -p 21,80,443,31337 <target>
```

- Script Scans (FTP example):
	- Scripts located in at: `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/` or just run `locate *.nse`

```bash
# You can use 
locate *ftp*.nse # Or use find if that's your thing
nmap -p 21 --script=<script> <target>
nmap -p 21 --script=ftp-* <target>
```

- Other Useful Options:

```bash
# Aggressive (enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute...) Pretty beefy, so probably use -v or apt-get some patience, because it'll probably take awhile
nmap -v -A <target>
# OS Detection
nmap -v -O <target>
# Default Script Scan
nmap -v -sC <target>
```

- Using Nmap over Proxychains:
	- So Proxychains is used to encapsulate TCP network traffic over a tunnel, so other protocols won't work (like ICMP with ping sweeps). Use the following syntax if you're running a scan over an SSH tunnel while pivoting through a network:

```bash
proxychains nmap -Pn -sT <target>
```

## Unicornscan

- Unicorn scan is a little faster at simply finding open ports sometimes:

```bash
unicornscan -p -a <target>
```

## Masscan

Exceptionally faster than `nmap` and `unicornscan`.

```bash
# Scan a range of ports over many hosts
masscan -p80,8000-8100 10.0.0.0/8
```

## Bscan

Go check out [bscan](https://github.com/welchbj/bscan). It runs a few well-known scanning tools that are native to Kali Linux and logically organizes the tool outputs into a directory and file structure based on the host and type of scan. Here's a basic syntax:

```bash
bscan --verbose-status --max-concurrency 5 <IP/target>
```

## HTTP Scanning

- `dirb` is a web directory brute forcer. Very useful for finding directories to probe on web apps

```bash
dirb <target>
```

- `nikto` scans for vulnerabilities and other helpful information

```bash
nikto -h <target> -p <port>
```

- `cewl` is a web scraper that makes wordlists for you. Pretty useful for conducting intellegent dictionary attacks

```bash
cewl -w <outputfile> <target>
```

- `wpscan` scans WordPress sites

```bash
# Looks for plugins
wpscan --url <target> --enumerate -p
```

### TODO
- SMB/SAMBA
- FTP
- SQL
- RPC
- DNS
- SMTP
- SNMP
- NFS

# Identifying Vulnerabilities

- <https://google.com>. Seriously, just google **everything**.

- <https://exploit-db.com>. You can go to the Exploit DB website (usually through a link on Google after searching for a vulnerable app)

- Or you can use the Kali local version called `searchsploit`

```bash
# You can also pipe this output to grep to search more precisely 
searchsploit <description/version numbers>
```

# Initial Access

## Brute Forcing

- `nmap`
- `john`
- `hydra`
- `medusa` is a web

## Web Apps

- `burpsuite`

### LFI / RFI

### Reverse Shells

Method:
1. Use your limited RCE to enumerate the scripting languages you can leverage.
2. Try shells from the following that match what is available on the target.

- perl
- bash
- netcat
- kali webshells
- ruby
- php
