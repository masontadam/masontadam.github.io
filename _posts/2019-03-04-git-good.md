Git was never meant to be such a daunting tool to use for software development. Still, it isn't actually that complicated if you just learn a few easy commands and follow a few usage conventions. 

# Git Workflow

The following blog article is the in-depth explanation of a solid Git workflow. Following these rules makes for a more streamlined git experience for collaborating on projects. Here's the article: [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). 

The article is a bit long, but everyone loves efficiency right? Seriously, it's worth your time if you frequently work on software in a group setting.

Once you've read the article, the following image will make sense and can serve as a neat reference.

# Git Commands

The most comprehensive, simple guide i've found to Git commands is by Roger Dudler: [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). 

I use it as my go-to reference every time I have a Git command question that the man page doesn't easily resolve.

## Basics

These commands will get you going. If you're just working by yourself and not really doing anything fancy, you should be able to get by with just these:

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git

# Propose, Commit, and Push changes to the remote repository
git add --all
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin <branch> # ex: master

# Pull any updates from the remote
git pull
```

## Branching

If you're trying to follow the git workflow model, you'll need to learn these commands...

Making New Branches:

```bash
# Create a new branch locally
git checkout -b feature_x

# Git add, commit...

# Push changes in the new branch to the remote
git push origin feature_x
```

Merging two branches:

```bash
# Merge a feature branch to the dev branch
git checkout dev
git merge --no-ff feature_x
```
- The `--no-ff` option above prevents losing information about the existence of feature branchs. Without the option, git will not create a new commit object, and a graph view will not distinguish the two newly merged branches. *Basically, it just makes your git graph view look more sensical.* For more information, reference the branch model blog at the top of this post.

## Fixing Mistakes

If you want to "revert" local changes in an individual file to your last commit:

```bash
git checkout -- <filename>
```

If you want to drop **all** local changes and commits because you _really_ messed something up use:

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

You can also use this syntax to basically undo a commit. The best time to use this is if you remember that what you just _committed_ is incomplete:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD^
```
