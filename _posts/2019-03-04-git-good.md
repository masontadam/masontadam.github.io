Git was never meant to be such a daunting tool to use for software development. Still, it isn't actually that complicated if you use few easy commands and follow a few flow conventions. 

# Git Workflow

The following blog article is the in-depth explanation of a solid Git workflow. Following the conventions that Vincent Driessen lays out makes for a more streamlined git experience for a group project. 

Here's the article: ["A successful Git branching model"](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Once you've read the article, the following reference image will make a ton of sense.

# Git Commands

The simpliest, comprehensive article i've found for Git commands is by Roger Dudler called ["git - the simple guide"](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). 

I use it as my first reference every time I have a Git command question that the man page doesn't easily resolve.

## Basics

Here are a few basic commands:

```bash
	# Clone a repository
	git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git

	# Propose, Commit, and Push changes to the remote repository
	git add --all
	git commit -m "Commit message"
	git push origin <branch> # ex: master

	# Pull any updates from the remote
	git pull
```

## Branching

Making New Branches:

```bash
	# Create a new branch locally
	git checkout -b feature_x

	# Git add, commit...

	# Push changes in the new branch to the remote
	git push origin feature_x
```

Merging two branches:

```bash
	# Merge a feature branch to the dev branch
	git checkout dev
	git merge --no-ff feature_x
```
- The `--no-ff` option above prevents losing information about the existence of feature branchs. Without the option, git will not create a new commit object, and a graph view will not distinguish the two newly merged branches. Basically, it just makes your graph view look more sensical. For more information, reference the branch model blog at the top of this post.

## Fixing Mistakes

If you want to "revert" local changes to an individual file to your last commit:

```bash
	git checkout -- <filename>
```

If you want to drop *all* local changes and commits because you _really_ messed something up use:

```bash
	git fetch origin
	git reset --hard origin/master
```

You can also use this syntax to basically undo a commit. The best time to use this is if you remember that what you just _committed_ is incomplete:
```bash
	git reset --soft HEAD^
```
